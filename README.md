# 3MOSmodel_LPF
A low-pass filter is a filter that passes signals with a
frequency lower than a selected cut-off frequency and
attenuates signals with frequencies higher than the cut-off
frequency.I have presented a model which will make the
bandwidth of the filters tuneable by controlling dc current.
